## What?   
A room mapping device that measures the dimensions of a room or a space within a room using an intuitive mobile application as the interface. Real time measurements will be shown to the user while the car is mapping. The measuring process is automated, while if the user wants to measure a distance that is not a full room (for example, one wall or part of a wall), they will have the possibility of controlling the car manually for a specific distance.


## Why?   
Makes it easier to visualise the plan of a room for renovating purposes or floor plans for real estate agents or home owners.


## How?   
The Arduino IDE will be used to implement the features of the car while Android Studio will be used to develop the application which serves as an interface for the car.
